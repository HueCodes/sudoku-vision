## test_images/

Sample photos of sudoku puzzles for testing the grid detection pipeline.
These are used to validate preprocessing, contour detection, and cell extraction.

## mnist/

The MNIST handwritten digit dataset. Downloaded automatically when running
`train.py --dataset mnist`. Used as baseline for digit recognition.

## synthetic/

Synthetically generated digit images with various fonts, rotations, and noise.
Generated by `ml/generate_synthetic.py` (not yet implemented).

## real/

Manually labeled cell images extracted from real sudoku puzzle photos.
Used for fine-tuning and testing accuracy on printed digits.

Expected format: `{digit}_{id}.png` (e.g., `5_0001.png`, `0_0042.png`)
where digit 0 means empty cell.
